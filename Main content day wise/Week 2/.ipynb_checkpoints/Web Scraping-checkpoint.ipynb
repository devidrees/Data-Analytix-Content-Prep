The code below shows how to build a regular expression that finds all the characters inside the < td > html tags and replace them with an empty string for each table row. First, you compile a regular expression by passing a string to match to re.compile(). The dot, star, and question mark (.*?) will match an opening angle bracket followed by anything and followed by a closing angle bracket. It matches text in a non-greedy fashion, that is, it matches the shortest possible string. If you omit the question mark, it will match all the text between the first opening angle bracket and the last closing angle bracket. After compiling a regular expression, you can use the re.sub() method to find all the substrings where the regular expression matches and replace them with an empty string. The full code below generates an empty list, extract text in between html tags for each row, and append it to the assigned list."
